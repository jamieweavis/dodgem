### `bump <target> <interval>`

Start bumping the specified target every interval

* `<target>` - Which trades to bump - `all` or `oldest`
  * `all` - Bumps all trades - Most effective when you have a variety of different trades
  * `oldest` - Bumps only the oldest trade - Most effective when you have lots of duplicate trades and you want to saturate the market
* `<interval>` - How many minutes to wait before bumping again

###### Examples:

```sh
# Bump all trades every 15 minutes
$ dodgem bump all 15

# Bump the oldest trade every 3 minutes
$ dodgem bump oldest 3
```
